WORDS USED INTERNALLY
===============================================================================

: book and fundament
the "book" is collection of documents, written against a "fundament" that tells
Do how to interpret the documents. "mie-urlyd" is the default sound/music
fundament, which combines the "mie" language with the "urlyd" audio engine.

: mim
editor protocol used internally, in journals on disk, and over-the-wire.
loosely inspired by, and named after "vim", but starting with "mi" as in
"do-re-mi" or "minimal".

: scrallox
scratch allocator used in the compiler, VM (in mie.c), and also for temporary
documents in gig.c.

: journal
a data structure, DO_JAM_JOURNAL on disk, that represents a Do-session as a
series of mim-commands. this is the only "source of truth", and snapshots (see
below) are derived from this.

: spool / spooling
processing a sequence of journal entries and applying them to the internal
snapshot state. this happens during startup, during time travel and upon user
input.

: snapshot
a data structure containing a materialised point-in-time version of a
Do-session. this is derived from the journal.

: snapshotcache
snapshotcache.data and snapshotcache.index collectively store snapshots on
disk. these files can be regenerated from the DO_JAM_JOURNAL file.

: insignia
random-ish number that is used to quickly detect if a snapshotcache file
belongs to the DO_JAM_JOURNAL.

: cursor vs caret
"caret" is used for your "text editing caret" (also sometimes called a
"cursor"), while "cursor" is used for the rest, like file/read/write cursors.

: colorchar
character consisting of a codepoint and a 4-component splash color (see:
splash4)

: docchar
document char consisting of a colorchar, flags and timestamp.

TODO : strchar? (mie string char, like colorchar but also contains source
location)

: splash4
4-component splash color, each component a decimal digit, like 5050 or 3333.
all valid colors are between 0000 and 9999. the components are RGBX where RGB
are red/green/blue, and X is "shake". the color 3456 is red=3, green=4, blue=5
and shake=6. the original splash (3-component) format was made by Lu Wilson aka
Todepond (https://www.todepond.com/lab/splash/)


===============================================================================

rule of thumb when coming up with new words:
if it's a unique concept to Do, that holds significant importance, and
especially if you want to be able to easily "track" this concept across the
source code, then choose a <word> that produces an empty or mostly empty
git-grep result:
  $ git grep -ni <word>
example: incorrect scrallox-usage can lead to very ugly bugs, so it's
convenient to easily be able to get a list of every mention by typing
  $ git grep -ni scrallox
